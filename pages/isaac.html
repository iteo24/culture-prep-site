        The article I chose was from Independent, titled: “The best London hotels for afternoon tea 2023: Where to visit
        for
        great views, elegance and delicious treats” by Kate Hilpern. In this article, Hilpern consolidated a wide
        variety of
        hotel restaurants, showcasing each one's strengths and noting which would be best for any kind of visitor. I
        chose
        this article because I thought it could provide some ideas for us to do (assuming I'm not mistaken and these
        places
        are restaurants within the hotels that non-guests can visit) during any free afternoons we might have while in
        London, and as a lover of tea and snacks, I was also personally interested.
        I found this article very insightful and helpful, as it provided a list with hyperlinks of every venue with
        their
        top strength and then proceeded to dive deeper into each in the main article. This makes it easy to simply look
        at
        the list in the beginning if you cannot be bothered to read the whole article while providing specifics for
        those
        who have the time. It also included room prices in case anyone might be interested in actually booking the hotel
        for
        a night, as well as expected prices per person at the restaurants themselves.
        While many of the hotels listed are on the pricier range (anywhere from £70-80 per person), the list also
        includes
        more affordable options more suitable for us broke college kids. The notably less expensive hotels included the
        Strand Palace Hotel, The Ampersand, Dean St Townhouse, and 11 Cadogan Gardens, whose prices range from around
        £30-50
        per person. I was personally most interested in the Dean St Townhouse, not only because it is the most
        affordable at
        £28 per person, but also because it seems to be a more quiet and relaxed experience than some of the more formal
        hotels might be. Overall, this article was very interesting and I think it gives our group some good options for
        when we are in London so that we can experience some of the culture and also eat some great food, and the
        variety of
        places means there is something for everyone.

        Market Jar is a London-based search engine optimization company focused on helping other businesses get better
        visibility and increase their revenue. They specialize in digital marketing strategies that will increase
        traffic through their websites and fit better with search engine algorithms. Market Jar calls themselves a
        revenue-focused agency, meaning their main goal is to ultimately increase their clients' revenue.
        Some of the services they offer are on-page SEO, which involves optimizing the websites themselves so they can
        rank higher by search engines, off-page SEO, which involves building a strong online presence, technical SEO,
        which is optimization on a much deeper level, and link building in order to “build a high-quality seo
        authority.”
        One thing I gathered from Market Jar's website is that they prioritize results over recognition. They pride
        themselves on their transparency with their clients, not promising solutions or using awards as credibility, but
        simply showing them what they can do. They describe themselves as “ethically minded seo professionals,” and seem
        to be genuinely looking to help other businesses grow.
        A testament to their transparency is their highly visible pricing on their website, as well as a page describing
        what clients can expect, broken down into an eight to nine month timeline. This timeline lays out what they will
        work on during each month, and gives an estimate on when the client can expect to see results. They also offer
        free “growth audit” calls so potential clients can get specific advice for their businesses. Keeping inline with
        the theme of transparency, they offer their clients regular updates so they can track progress, as well as
        monthly audits where they go in-depth to describe what has been fixed and how.
