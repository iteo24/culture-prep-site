        The GCSEs are a series of exams in every subject, and students taking them are required to pass them to attend
        University. Failing leads instead to alternate occupations, as far as I can gather, akin to the trades. These
        exams
        are so centralizing that multiple years of education are devoted entirely to preparing for them. This is
        detrimental
        to the education of the students, as by educating to these exams students are given a transactional view of
        education where the purpose of learning is to prepare for an exam. This is harmed further by the amount of time
        focused on preparing students for this one specific exam. If these classes are taught anything like AP classes
        here,
        then students will learn techniques that, while not good for use in a professional setting, earn points on these
        exams. This is especially harmful to the humanities, where work is more expressive, and a formula is especially
        crippling.
